## How to use

`ember-showcase` is an addon that provides you with component abstractions
that you can build upon to showcase interactive code-samples in your
applications.

This can be useful for documenting an addon, a styleguide or when writing
a blog.

`ember-showcase` comes with no styling. As it is meant as a base for your own
abstraction on top of it you can style it as you see fit. The follwing guide
walks you through the existing components in `ember-showcase` and how you could
create your own component abstraction on top of it.

## Components

### Showcase

The `Showcase`-component is a provider component that yields out everything you
need to build your own interactive code sample component.

`Showcase` yields a nested hash that holds the following properties:

* `ui` - a set of declarative components
  * `useSnippet` - a component that you use to register snippets to the `Showcase`
  * `snippet` - a component that renders a code snippet
* `state `- state of the `Showcase` you can use to build your own code sample
  abstraction
  * `activeSnippet` - the currently active code snippet of all all the registered
    snippets. By default this will be the first registered snippet
  * `snippets` - all the registered snippets on the `Showcase`
* `actions` - a set of actions you can trigger on the `Showcase`
  * `registerSnippet` - an action to register a code snippet on the `Showcase`
  * `activateSnippet` - an action to switch out the currently active snippet

## Example

In this example we will walk you through creating your own `Demo`-component
that is based on `ember-showcase`. `Demo` will be able to show an interactive
code sample - i.e. an ui that shows the code to demo in action. You will also
be able to attach an optional set of code-snippets (based on
[ember-code-snippet](https://github.com/ef4/ember-code-snippet)) that you can
toggle between to show other developers how the component you are demoing will
be used in code.

Here's how you will be able to use it:

<!-- BEGIN-SNIPPET demo-usage -->
<Demo as |demo|>
  <div>
    Hello world!
  </div>
  <demo.ui.useSnippet @name="demo-usage.md" @title="template.hbs" @language="html" />
</Demo>
<!-- END-SNIPPET -->

And here's how you would use `ember-showcase` to implement `Demo`:

<Snippet @name="demo.hbs" @language="html" />
