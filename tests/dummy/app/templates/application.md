## How to install

To install `ember-showcase` use the regular `ember-cli`-command to install an addon:

<Snippet @name="install-ember-showcase.sh" @language="shell-session"/>

## How to use

`ember-showcase` is an addon that provides you with component abstractions
that you can build upon to showcase interactive code-samples in your
applications.

This can be useful for documenting an addon, a styleguide or when writing
a blog.

`ember-showcase` comes with no styling - the component it provides are not
meant to to be used as they come. The bundled componens of `ember-showcase` are
primitives that you will use to build your own component abstraction for
displaying interactive code samples that you style to your liking.

The following guide walks you through the existing components in `ember-showcase`
and how you can use it to  create your own component abstraction on top of it.

## Components

### Showcase

The `Showcase`-component is a provider component that yields out everything you
need to build your own interactive code sample component.

`Showcase` - yields a nested hash that holds the following properties:

* `ui` - a set of declarative components
  * `useSnippet` - a component that you use to register snippets to the `Showcase`
  * `snippet` - a component that renders a code snippet
* `state `- state of the `Showcase` you can use to build your own code sample
  abstraction
  * `activeSnippet` - the currently active code snippet of all all the registered
    snippets. By default this will be the first registered snippet
  * `snippets` - all the registered snippets on the `Showcase`
* `actions` - a set of actions you can trigger on the `Showcase`
  * `registerSnippet` - an action to register a code snippet on the `Showcase`
  * `activateSnippet` - an action to switch out the currently active snippet

### Snippet
The `Snippet`-component is a component that you can use to render code-snippets registered via
[ember-code-snippets](https://github.com/ef4/ember-code-snippet). Highlighting
code snippets is handled via [ember-prism](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-prism).
## Example

In this example we will walk you through creating your own `Demo`-component
that is based on `ember-showcase`. `Demo` will be able to show an interactive
code sample - i.e. an ui that shows the code to demo in action. You will also
be able to attach an optional set of code-snippets (based on
[ember-code-snippet](https://github.com/ef4/ember-code-snippet)) that you can
toggle between to show other developers how the component you are demoing will
be used in code. Code highlighting is based on
[ember-prism](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-prism) if you want to customize the theme used in code snippets please configure `ember-prism` accordingly.

This guide is customizing `ember-prism` in the following way for example:

<Snippet @name="prism.js" @title="ember-cli-build.js" />

### `Demo`-Usage

Here's how you will be able to use the `Demo` component:

<!-- BEGIN-SNIPPET demo-usage -->
<Demo as |demo|>
  <!-- BEGIN-SNIPPET code-snippet -->
  <div>
    Hello world!
  </div>
  <!-- END-SNIPPET -->
  <demo.ui.useSnippet @name="demo-usage.md" @title="template.hbs" @language="html" />
  <demo.ui.useSnippet @name="code-snippet.md" @title="snippet-usage" @language="html" />
</Demo>
<!-- END-SNIPPET -->

### Implementing `Demo`
And here's how you would use `ember-showcase` to implement `Demo` - you don't
need to do more than create your own component wrapper that uses `Showcase`
internally - the example uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for
styling but you can use whatever CSS authoring method you are comfortable with:

<Snippet @name="demo.hbs" @language="html" />
